		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			As the globe recovers from Covid, demand for air travel has also recovered. This, however, returns with the many discomforts of air travel. Ranging from gate changes, delays, TSA security, as well as boarding and leaving the terminal, these hiccups in travel make it all the more unpleasant. Our company, MyJourney, aims to alleviate some of the anxiety tied to these issues. By building an application that can help alert users of flight delays, traffic congestion, TSA wait time, and provide accurate travel times to the airport, we believe we can capitalize on an emerging market.
